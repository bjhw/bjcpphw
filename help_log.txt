The Visual C++ help contains extensive help on almost every build error you receive, and how to solve each one. Whenever you receive a build error, it should be the first place you search for. To access it, click on the line which says:

.\example2.cpp(8) : fatal error C1010: unexpected end of file while looking for precompiled header. Did you forget to add '#include "stdafx.h"' to your source?

), and then press F1. This will take you to the offline version of this page, which contains everything you want to know about error C1010.

That page tells you to:

   1.

      Click on the Project Menu -> example2 Properties.
   2.

      In the left pane, click the C/C++ folder.
   3.

      Click the Precompiled Headers node.
   4.

      Set this node to Not using Precompiled Headers.

Follow these steps and your error should be resolved.
