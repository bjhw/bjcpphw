Callbacks in C++

Information on a callback library, a callback paper, new patterns used by the paper, and complete source code for each step presented in the paper.
Free C++ Callback Library - Callback 1.0

A free library based on the final solution described in Callback Implementations in C++. This library allows callbacks to functions (function pointers), function objects, member functions, and member data that are function pointers or function objects. The library has a very permissive copyright to encourage its use.

    * callback.1.0: directory with ~15 files totalling ~40 KB. Must use included perl script to generate C++ code.
    * callback.1.0.noperl: directory with ~60 files totalling ~130 KB. Library preinstantiated for Callback0, Callback1, Callback2, Callback0wRet, Callback1wRet, and Callback2wRet. No perl script.
    * callback.1.0.noperl.vcpp - directory with ~60 files totalling ~130 KB. Just like callback.1.0.noperl except files generated to be compatible with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0.

Paper - Callback Implementations in C++

This paper explores several C++ callback implmentations using patterns.

    * callback.pdf: ~107 KB pdf formatted paper -- can be viewed with Adobe Acrobat Reader

New Patterns

The following patterns are specific to C++ unless otherwise noted.

    * parameterize method name - not C++ specific
    * separate client and server interface specifications
    * automatically detect types
    * factor templates
    * destroyer of type is restorer
    * manual polymorphism
    * dual purpose class (only if you have to)

Source Code
common evolution

    * simple solution
    * abstract client
    * adapter
    * external polymorphism
    * parameterize method name
    * separate client and server interface specification
    * automatically detect types

efficient callback

    * factor template
    * manual polymorphism
    * dual purpose class

simpler and more powerful callback

    * handle body
    * counted body
    * null object
